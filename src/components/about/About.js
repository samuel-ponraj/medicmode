						<h3>First Responder and CPR Training</h3>
						<p>We believe that the future of EMS lies in creating empowered lay first responders who can deliver essential, initial care in emergency situations. Our community-centred approach is realised through CPR and first aid courses offered in schools, colleges, and industrial setups. Our “Chennai Knows CPR” initiative embodies this mission by training thousands in lifesaving skills across Chennai, creating a safer and more prepared community. We are proud to have been among the first organisations in Chennai, and the second in Tamil Nadu, to conduct CPR and first aid training for the transgender community, fostering inclusivity in EMS training.</p>

				<h2>The Need for <span style={{color:'var(--orange)'}}>Community Training</span></h2>
				<p>India’s rapid population growth and diverse geography pose unique challenges to EMS. The average ambulance response time is approximately 20 minutes in urban areas and can extend to 40 minutes in rural regions. In response, we focus on first responder training at an affordable cost, enabling community members to step in and administer initial care before EMS arrival. This “bridging care” approach ensures that essential help is available, regardless of location, and underscores our belief that empowered communities play a vital role in emergency response.</p>
